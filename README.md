#Web_API_CHALLENGE
An application that when run will begin a short 5 question quiz on javascript.

When the user selects "start quiz" the first question will get displayed along with the 4 multiple choice buttons. 

The user will click their answers and will have 100 seconds to complete the quiz. When the user selects an incorrect answer, 10 seconds are removed from the timer.

The user's final score will be the amount of time left. At the end of the quiz, the user is prompted to enter in their initials to display their score in the high scores list. 

When the user clicks submit, their initials are added to the local storage and sorted into descending order. 

If the user clicks on highscores, they are taken to the highscores html page where the list of highscores is saved.

The user may return to the main page to retake the quiz, or clear the list of all the high scores.
